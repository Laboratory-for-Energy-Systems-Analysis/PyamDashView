    name: "Base"
    description: "A scenario where emissions continue to grow at the same rate as in the past."
RCP6:
  name: "Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0 W/m2"
  description: "A stabilization scenario where total radiative forcing is stabilized before 2100 by employment of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions."

RCP45:
  name: "Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 W/m2"
  description: "A stabilization scenario where greenhouse gas emissions peak around 2040, then decline, resulting in an increase in radiative forcing to 4.5 W/m^2 by the end of the century."

RCP26:
  name: "Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 W/m2"
  description: "A peak-and-decline scenario with the most stringent mitigation measures, where emissions peak before 2020 and lead to a radiative forcing level of 2.6 W/m^2 by 2100."

RCP19:
  name: "Representative Concentration Pathway 1.9 W/m2"
  description: "A very stringent mitigation scenario aiming to limit global warming to 1.5째C above pre-industrial levels with a radiative forcing target of 1.9 W/m^2 by 2100."

NDC:
  name: "National Determined Contributions"
  description: "Nationally Determined Contributions, where individual countries set emissions reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2째C."

NPi:
  name: "No additional Policy"
  description: "No Policy scenario, a representation of future emissions if no climate policies or mitigation measures were implemented beyond those in place today."

PkBudg1150:
  name: "Peak Budget 1150 GtCO2"
  description: "A scenario where cumulative emissions are limited to 1150 GtCO2, resulting in a 66% chance of limiting global warming to 2째C above pre-industrial levels."

  name: "Peak Budget 500 GtCO2"
  description: "A scenario where cumulative emissions are limited to 500 GtCO2, resulting in a 66% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5째C above pre-industrial levels."
